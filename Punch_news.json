    "Leah Sharibu: Recent reports confusing, disheartening, unsubstantiated rumours - Parents": "Parents of Leah Sharibu on Thursday broke their silence on the insinuations concerning the marital status and whereabouts of their daughter describing such thoughts as both confusing and disheartening.\nThey wondered why they should believe unsubstantiated rumors and scant information that \u201clocal security sources made this revelation in a report.\u201d\nThe spokesperson for the parents and President of Leah Foundation, Dr Gloria Puldu, made the clarification in a statement she sent to The PUNCH, following insinuations that Sharibu already had two children and had married another man after reportedly divorcing her first husband.\nWhile calling on President Bola Tinubu to act fast, they recalled that till he left office on May 29 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari did not act on the promise he made to free Leah Sharibu two years after her abduction, adding that the international community had abandoned Leah and others still being held captive. \n\u201cThe global community seems to have forgotten Leah\u2019s plight (and other girls like her) and allowed Nigeria to devolve into the chaos that it is currently in. No one is demanding accountability or transparency from Nigeria, but continues to give billions of dollars in aid and relief. Leah remains a captive to a militant religious group within Nigeria without any apparent knowledge of her whereabouts\u201d, they said.\nLeah Sharibu was one of the 110 female students of the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, who were abducted on February 19, 2018, by Boko Haram terrorists.\nWhile others were released by the terrorists following negotiations, Leah, then 14 year-old, is still being held captive because she refused to renounce her Christian faith.      \nThe PUNCH reported that there were insinuations that Leah Sharibu held by members of Islamic State West Africa Province has \u201cremarried\u201d another terrorists\u2019 commander, after purportedly securing a divorce from the first \u2018husband\u2019 forced on her.\nLeah, after the purported divorce from one Abdulrahman, it was alleged, was remarried to another ISWAP commander in the Lake Chad area named Ali Abdallah.  Related News   Leah Sharibu has been married thrice \u2014 Activist  Rivers APC expresses shock over Tinubu's appointment of PDP members  Tinubu begs US court not to release privileged documents   \nBut her parents described the allegations as confusing and disheartening.\nThe statement by Puldu reads, \u201cRecent reports on Leah Sharibu, the young girl taken captive by ISWAP terrorists over five years ago, is both confusing and disheartening. It\u2019s confusing because there have been unsubstantiated rumours and scant information regarding the whereabouts of Leah. There were a few reports by those who were released or had escaped claiming that she might have been married off and given birth to two children. No pictures, audio or video has ever surfaced and, If anything, these were assumptions based on her age and condition of captivity.\n\u201cWhy should we believe, \u201cLocal security sources made this revelation in a report\u201d? If they have intelligence on Leah\u2019s whereabouts and any information, then where are the Nigerian armed forces? Why isn\u2019t the government involved in securing her release?\n\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening because only so often do we hear anything on Leah Sharibu. On the two-year anniversary of Leah\u2019s capture, President Buhari said that, \u201c\u2026we redouble our efforts for Leah\u2019s return, we can never allow the terrorists to divide us\u2026\u201d. Nathan and Rebecca Sharibu are asking what happened to that promise? Buhari left office without fulfilling that promise of rescuing our daughter, Leah. Our family remains grief-stricken by our daughter\u2019s capture and ongoing imprisonment, even as the Nigerian government has been unsuccessful in securing her release.\n\u201cIn March 2020, Leah\u2019s father, Nathan Sharibu pleaded, \u2018I have not heard anything from federal, state and local governments since my daughter was abducted. I am even confused now. I need your assistance to put pressure on the Federal Government to do something about the release of my daughter.\u2019        \nPuldu said it had been so sad that abductions of students were still ongoing even in the new administration of President Bola Tinubu.\nShe said, \u201cAbout a week ago we woke up to the news of students abducted from Zamfara. This is very shameful and disheartening to Nigerian parents. Despite the terrible economic hardship, parents still have to grapple with the safety of their children in school. We are calling again with a very strong and loud voice on the current government led by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to please wake up to its very primary responsibility of safety and protection of the lives and properties of Nigerian citizens.\n\u201cWe demand the rescue of Leah Sharibu and all others who had in captivity in the hands of terrorists.\u201d",
    "Poorly paid, bruised and gagged,  Nigerian referees breathe new life": "In this special report ABIODUN ADEWALE takes a look at the plight of Nigerian referees who have been victimised while doing their jobs in the domestic league\nAt the mention of Nigerian referees, two perceptions easily come to mind.\nIn the first instance, they are largely perceived as one of the \u2018enemies\u2019, if not the principal \u2018enemy\u2019 of Nigerian football.\nOn the other hand, they are pathetically seen as the \u2018victims\u2019 of the dangers of Nigerian football. Depending on who you ask, either of the perspectives would be proven beyond reasonable doubts. \nAn average Nigerian league player or coach has the most horrible stories to tell about referees in all the tiers of the country\u2019s league, but ironically, a lot of them maintain relationships with these refs off the field of play.\nFootball administrators are also on either side of the divide, depending on how mutual their relationships with the men in the middle is. For the fans, they can only watch from afar and wonder why certain things they can\u2019t comprehend happen in the game they love so much. And when results don\u2019t go their way, they vent their anger on the refs, inflicting serious injuries on them, in some cases.\nFrom the Nigeria Professional Football League to the Nigeria Women\u2019s Football League and the lower tiers of the men and women\u2019s game in the country, there are different circumstances that have shaped these perspectives.      \nAs a result of being perceived as enemies of their teams by overzealous fans, Nigerian refs have been assaulted on many occasions due to circumstances beyond their control, thus making them the victims and enemies of the game at the same time. It is hard to recall any situation where the referees have been applauded openly as much as they are given the stick.\nFirst experience \nWhile the crazy culture of assaulting referees has been a long-time occurrence in the Nigerian leagues, our correspondent first witnessed it in 2015 at the Ondo State Sports Complex in Akure, during an NPFL game between Sunshine Stars and Lobi Stars.\nIt was the run-in to the end of the season and Sunshine were on course for the title as well as a return to the continent. Needing a win to keep up their neck-and-neck race with Enyimba and Warri Wolves, the Akure side were frustrated by their resilient visitors, who struck them against the run of play to take a 3-2 lead with time fast running out.\nWith about 10 minutes left on the clock, projectiles began to fly onto the pitch after what the fans perceived as unfavourable officiating towards their darling team. The home fans made the atmosphere uneasy and it became impossible for the centre ref and his assistants to continue the game, much to the anger of the fans.\nSunshine Stars players, perhaps aware of the consequences of such acts, went round the stands to appeal to their fans, but their pleas fell on deaf ears. Eventually, the game did not continue as the officials were stranded on the pitch, leaving them at the mercy of unruly fans, who were bent on dealing blows and sticks on them. The referee and his assistants had to be wheeled away in a vehicle thought to belong to the then chairman of the Ondo State Football Agency, Akin Akinbobola, which was driven straight onto the pitch and the sticks that could have landed on the officials landed on the car instead.\nThe last 10 minutes of the game was played in Abuja and Sunshine Stars were subsequently banned to the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos for the remainder of the season.        \nRefs beaten again in Akure\nNot the NPFL this time around but a Nationwide League One game between Akure City and Hammola FC from Osun State in 2022. In what would have been described as a good outing for the away side, who got a 2-1 victory over their hosts, the outcome of the game set up the officials for beating as locals perceived them as biased against the home team.\nJust before full time, the fans converged on the side of the pitch, with various items they could lay their hands on, threatened all cameramen to stop recording and pounced on the centre ref and one of his assistants, who ran across the pitch helplessly.\nPlayers and officials of the home team were as surprised as their visitors and the actions of their unruly fans cost them their slot in the NLO.\nRegular victims\nIn 2019, during the Nigeria Professional Football League Super 6 playoffs at the Agege Township Stadium in Lagos, Kano Pillars captain Rabiu Ali was in the middle of one of the biggest assaults on match officials after charging towards referee Adebimpe Quadri over what he perceived as biased officiating against his team.\nHis action fuelled the rage of the fans, who wielded sticks against the helpless officials. Although the player later denied abusing or attacking the referee, Ali was eventually banned for 12 games and Pillars fined N8m by the then League Management Company.      \nBefore the playoffs in 2019, the Nigeria Referees Association, threatened a boycott of games if their security at match venues was not guaranteed. This came after an attack on a ref, Bethel Nwanesi, during an NPFL match-day three game between Remo Stars and Bendel Insurance in Sagamu.\n\u201cThe weekly reports of attacks on referees at the match venues whenever home teams fail to win on their grounds since the 2018/2019 league commenced may have caused a change in the association\u2019s approach,\u201d the NRA said.\n\u201cRecall that the sore point witnessed so far in the top Nigeria league that is in week three is the `one week, one attack on referee\u2019 incidents.\n\u201cIn the week one match in Jos, Plateau, Plateau United vs Ifeanyi Uba FC, the referees were beaten blue and back by supporters of the home side because they drew at home. We also urge football authorities in the country to wade into the matter because the association is on the verge of asking its members to keep away from the league to avoid being killed by rampaging supporters,\u201d\nthe NRA added.\nPerhaps that NRA\u2019s statement was seen as a mere threat and truly they didn\u2019t boycott matches. Rather, the only thing that changed was the pattern of attacks as it continued through 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nIn 2023, there has been at least two cases of assaults on match officials, which resulted in docking of accrued points and goals from the erring clubs after investigation by the authorities.  \nBayelsa United were the first club to be caught in the web of the Interim Management Committee of the NPFL after an assistant ref Ebenezer Ojeleye was attacked during their match against Doma United.\nBayelsa United later identified the perpetrator as Joseph Zidougha, popularly known as \u2018One Man Riot\u2019, but they were found guilty of breaching the frameworks of the league and subsequently had three points and three goals deducted from their accrued tally.\nTowards the end of the regular season as well, Plateau United were also found wanting of security breaches during their 2-1 loss to Remo at the New Jos Stadium. Aside from points deduction, a fine of N2.5m was imposed on the club.\nNotorious lower leagues\nPerhaps due to sanctions that are meted out to teams in the NPFL over fans trouble, there is usually a level of diplomacy that comes with burying it after it happens \u2013 although the punishment of fines and suspended points deduction didn\u2019t totally prevent it from happening until recently.\nHowever, the lower leagues in the country are notorious for assaulting match officials with three barbaric cases in the 2023 Nigeria National League alone.\nEarlier this year, Smart City and Crown FC were charged by the Nigeria National League following the unruly behaviour of their fans, which led to an assault on referee Oni Stephen and his assistants. In a viral video which was obtained by our correspondent, the fans of Smart City made their way onto the pitch, assaulting match officials, inflicting bodily injuries and stealing items from them after the ref sent off one of their players, Tunde Adejokun.      \nIn another instance this year, a match official from Kano State, Shaarani Guza, lost his teeth after he was assaulted by irate fans of Yobe Desert Stars during their match-day five encounter with DMD FC of Borno. Yobe were fined N3m and forfeited three points and three goals from their accrued points in Group A4 of the Northern Conference of the NNL as a punishment.\nThe most recent and uncivilised incident in the lower league was at Awka, Anambra State, during a game between Edel FC and Giant Brillars, where the ref Charwal Wilfred, from Delta State, had his head broken, his assistants Asoluku Ihuoma from Imo State and Uhuegbu Femi of Delta State sustained varying degrees of injuries as well. The match commissioner Oyekezie Ekene from Enugu State was also not spared during the ugly incident allegedly spearheaded by Edel players.\nBlame game\nBefore the fans can tag refs as enemies of the game, the people directly affected by their decisions are the players and they also have harrowing tales of how they had been affected by poor officiating, even if they have also been caught in the web of leading attacks on referees.\n\u201cOne of the reasons Wikki Tourists didn\u2019t survive relegation last season was due to poor officiating. So many crucial decisions went against us in different matches and there was no probe whatsoever,\u201d Wikki forward, Fu\u2019ad Ekelojuoti, told our correspondent.\nAfter their 2-2 draw against Enyimba in the opening game of the 2022/23 NPFL Super 6 playoffs, Remo captain Junior Nduka could not hide his anger after the champions were awarded a penalty for a foul he claimed to have committed outside the box.\n\u201cI believe everyone saw this one on live TV, yes it was a foul but that was outside the box,\u201d Nduka fumed.        \n\u201cI have seen all types of officiating, in the NNL where I played a year ago, there was this away game we went for and we had the game under control, but then the referee frustrated us to ensure we lost because his life was at stake,\u201d former 3SC striker Anthony Okachi also told The PUNCH.\n\u201cEven in the NPFL people talk about how the home team always win. Then when I go for away games I feel like we are just going to honour the game. I can\u2019t state all the really crazy decisions I have witnessed because there are so many.\u201d\nFor the fans, no member of their group will charge\u00a0 at an official.\n\u201cWe know ourselves and we are usually in uniform during our matches. None of us can do that because such can easily be pinned on the club. Our job is to support and entertain, which we do with passion. These acts are carried out by the so-called stadium boys that we cannot really tag as fans,\u201d Tunde Adeboboye, the chairman of the supporters\u2019 club of Sunshine Stars, told our correspondent.\nRefs horrible experiences\nAssaults have brought near death and traumatic situations for the men in the middle and most of the experiences point in the same direction; they are always at the mercy of the home fans, especially in the no-coverage areas of the stadium. According to them, not even live television coverage guarantees their safety.\n\u201cThe fact that a match is streamed live does not even factor into the protection of referees. This is because there is no coverage of what happens in the tunnels and even dressing rooms at half time. A lot has been reported by journalists, but you will only report what you see,\u201d an active NPFL ref, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The PUNCH.      \n\u201cAhmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna is notorious for this, a referee was almost killed there in 2022, in a game between Niger Tornadoes and Lobi Stars. The match did not continue. The same thing happened during Jigawa Golden Stars versus Rivers United and Kano pillars versus Plateau United, all in Kaduna,\u201d he said.  Related News   15 teams for 2021 Coal City Football League  Sierra Leone pro football league gets first female coach   \nA retired FIFA-badged referee, Henry Ogunyanmodi, narrated how he was assaulted in the dressing room during a live NPFL game in 2013/2014.\n\u201cIt happened to me in 2014 during a league game in Uyo between Akwa United and Warri Wolves. Interestingly, it was a live match and everything seemed to be going on well until halftime. In fact, Akwa United were leading 2-0. But surprisingly, when we got to the dressing room, they started beating us,\u201d Ogunyanmodi told our correspondent.\n\u201cNobody knew what happened in the dressing room, so I decided we won\u2019t continue the game because of our safety. After I observed the tunnel properly, I ran onto the pitch and I drew attention to the incident.\n\u201cThe second half of the game was played in Katsina and Akwa incurred the cost for the away team as well. I also remember that two of our colleagues had been victims there before. One retired FIFA female referee Felicia and another were beaten at the same venue before.\u201d\nEven while the home team was in control of the game, Ogunyanmodi insisted that it is natural to suspect the home when such an incident happens because the state football associations of the home teams are supposed to provide adequate security. If there will be any breach, it will be as a result of their negligence or compromise.\nRefs\u2019 deaths      \nAfter passing through all these difficulties to get their job done, there are instances where referees don\u2019t make it back home, not because they were killed by fans but sadly because of road accidents caused by long journeys.\nIn February this year, an Imo State referee, Dr. Kingsley Eneogwe, died in a road accident on the Abuja-Kogi-Enugu road after returning from a match-day five game between Nasarawa United and Plateau United in Kaduna.\nWhy always refs?\nAmid all the patterns associated with the safety of refs while carrying out their jobs, sometimes the urge for soul searching will call for the question; \u2018why would anyone even beat a referee?\u2019\nThe popular opinion is that, most times, they are bribed by the home team to turn results in their favour, thereby leaving the away team at the mercy of poor officiating. But in contrast, assaults are allegedly carried out by the home fans.\nThe PUNCH gathered that refs under the then LMC were owed indemnities for several seasons, leading to an arrangement in which home teams took care of their fees like transportation, accommodation and even feeding.\nThe inability of the defunct League Management Company to fulfil its financial obligations to the men in the middle further cemented the notion that refs were at the mercy of home teams or even the highest bidders.      \n\u201cNo, referees are not being offered money. Would you offer money to a man you know cannot change the outcome of a match? Poor officiating is definitely not about money, it\u2019s either about security, poor understanding of the laws of the game, lack of equipment for referees and poor physical, emotional and mental form,\u201d Olalekan Daramola, an NPFL referee, told The PUNCH.\nAccording to Ogunyanmodi, in cases where home teams offer incentives in the guise of augmenting transportation or any form of allowances, it is more dangerous to reject such money than to accept it.\n\u201cThe mentality is that when you refuse, you have connived with the away team. And whether you accept or not, the away team will also suspect you. Due to the situation we had then, they are the one that will house you in a hotel and feed you. They are always with you. So, they will think you have something against them if you refuse,\u201d Ogunyanmodi said.\nHe maintained that safety becomes an issue as soon as money is involved.\n\u201cRegardless of the inadequate situation of the league body then, no referee will ever ask clubs for money. It is not possible, but it is the clubs who put us in difficult situations with their money,\u201d he said.\nFor the sake of neutrality, the state football associations are supposed to be in charge of arrangements such as security, transportation and accommodation of the referees.\n\u201cThe state football associations are in charge of accommodation and feeding of the referees. But the FA is resident with the home team. Until we get to a point that home teams won\u2019t know the whereabouts of designated officials for their games, that is when these notions will disappear,\u201d Ogunyanmodi added.      \nDaramola rates the performances of the whistle men highly.\n\u201cOfficiating in the NPFL since I have been in the league has been relatively good. Sometimes at par with even the English Premier League. However, we have had some instances where there are some bad officiating, mostly caused by poor understanding of the laws of the game,\u201d he said.\nEvidently, the results over the past three seasons have an average of at least one away win and three draws per week. A statistic that was hard to come by in the NPFL years ago. Also, match-day one of last season produced four away wins, while two other teams got invaluable draws away from home.\nFIFA, CAF shun refs\nIn recent years, there has been public outcry within the football sector about the inability of Nigerian refs to officiate in African and world football. As a successful footballing nation, the expectations of enthusiasts is to see Nigerian officials go as far as Nigerian football stars, but they have been overlooked for major duties in Africa and at the global level.\nOn this, Ogunyanmodi told to our correspondent that the problem was internal. He claimed the promotion and projection of refs for international tournaments and even getting the FIFA badge had been characterised by politics, a situation he said led to his early retirement from officiating.\n\u201cMy mates in other countries are still actively officiating, but I am retired. Not long after I got the FIFA badge, it was stripped off\u00a0 me due to ethnicity. Surprisingly, it was handed to another person from the south west on the claims that the badge was not supposed to come to Ondo State when it came,\u201d Ogunyanmodi lamented.      \nPresident of the Nigeria Referees Association, Sanni Zubairu, explained that there had been a gap in that area, which the body is now trying to adequately fill.\n\u201cIn terms of performance, Nigerian referees are equal to any referee in the world. We have been watching and projecting the younger referees, some of them are now badged as FIFA referees and we have been moving on with them. There is a sort of gap between the ones we had before and now, and that is what we are trying to fill up,\u201d Zubairu told The PUNCH.\nNFF wants to install VAR\nGlobal football globally hinges on technology and one of the most important reasons for that is to reduce controversy to the barest minimum. World football body FIFA introduced the goal line technology in 2012 and more recently, the Video Assistant Referee, which gives the men in the middle the benefit of replays and reversal of decisions.\nBefore these two technologies, there were other basic communication technologies for refs that Nigeria is yet to invest on. In order to improve the performances of these officials, it becomes necessary to provide them with all the necessary support that will aid their work.\nEarlier this year, the Nigeria Football Federation boss, Ibrahim Gusau, announced that the body would build VARs in selected stadiums across the country, a proposal the NRA is already anticipating its implementation.\n\u201cFootball is now being played with technology and we must move with the pace of the world as well. If the NFF provides VARs in some centres, it will help the performances of our referees as well,\u201d NRA president, Zubairu, said.      \n\u201cOn our own, according to our plans, we will ensure the adequate training of our referees to meet up with the best global practices.\u201d\nImproved conditions? \nBefore the start of the abridged 2022/23 season, Chairman of the Interim Management Committee of the NPFL, Gbenga Elegbeleye, revealed that the defunct League Management Company owed referees to the tune of N500m.\nAs a result, the IMC created a new structure for the payment of referees\u2019 indemnities through their partners.\n\u201cTheir money is calculated by the distance they travel to their match venues. We spend close to 10m on match officials every match-day. The least amount a ref can earn is N200,000 or N150,000 per match for transport and feeding,\u201d an official of GTI Group, strategic partners of the NPFL, told our correspondent.\n\u201cAll the officials have their accommodations paid for, 48 hours before they arrive at their match venue. As they take off, they get their money and they know where they will lodge. We pay accommodation straight to the hotel, while feeding and transport allowances are paid in cash before they (refs) leave for their match venues.\u00a0 Things have changed, it\u2019s not like before.\n\u201cThe total money we spend on match days is between N9m and N10m and we pay all the FAs that are hosting matches for logistics. They don\u2019t have anything to do with referees, match commissioners or assessors.\u201d      \nThis move by the IMC is attested to by NRA boss Zubairu and Daramola.\n\u201cBefore the start of the season, NFF president Gusau met with us and gave us his assurances, particularly about the welfare and security of referees, and I can say that we saw it manifest last season,\u201d Zubairu said.\n\u201cThe indemnities are being paid, most times days before you even go for your match. It makes it easy for referees to prepare for matches, referees don\u2019t need to look around for money for transportation,\u201d Daramola said.\nAside from the improved welfare of the referees, the IMC did not hesitate to slam punishments on clubs, just as it did not hesitate to punish any referee that was found wanting for questionable calls.\nThe IMC deducted three points and three goals each from Bayelsa United, Remo Stars, Wikki Tourists and Plateau United over reports of violence against match officials during their matches. After investigation, Remo and Wikki were spared but Bayelsa and Plateau didn\u2019t escape the hammer.\nIn the case of referees, the committee of the NFF in January suspended Ndubuisi Ukah (Imo), Otuwho Morrison (Delta) and Faro Abdulrahman (Lagos) for questionable officiating.\nBut the questions remain \u2014 will the Nigerian football faithful ever trust the country\u2019s refs to diligently carry out their duties without fear or favour? And how soon will these defenceless middle men be protected from irate thugs, who in the guise of fans, bruise and brutalise them because results don\u2019t go their?      \nWhen this happens, then they will certainly be assured that rather than sow tears and sweat and reap blood, sorrow and deaths, they can earn a living in a safe environment where they will reap joy and meaningful lifestyles.",

    "[UPDATED] Chicago academic record: Atiku files reply to Tinubu's review application": "The legal team of the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has filed a motion to challenge President Bola Tinubu\u2019s plea for Chicago State University not to release privileged documents in his academic records.\nThe Special Adviser to Atiku on Public Communications, Phrank Shaibu, disclosed to The PUNCH that the legal team had up to 48 hours to respond to the motion in the US court.\n\u00a0Atiku had earlier secured an order for the CSU to make the President\u2019s academic records available to his legal team.\nA magistrate, Jeffrey Gilbert, had last week ordered Tinubu\u2019s alma mater to provide all relevant and non-privileged documents to the applicant within two days. \nAtiku is currently challenging the victory of the former Lagos State governor at the 2023 presidential poll and his recent affirmation by an election petition court in Nigeria.\nThe documents sought by the PDP candidate, through his counsel, Angela Liu, include the record of admission and acceptance at the university, dates of attendance including degrees, awards, and honours attained by the former governor of Lagos State at the university, among others.\nBut as the deadline given by Gilbert drew nearer on Thursday, Tinubu\u2019s lawyers approached a United States District judge, Nancy Maldonado, arguing that the earlier decision by the former (Gilbert) needed to be reviewed by a district judge.      \nThe request for a review and delay of the order till Monday was eventually granted by the US district judge.

    "Women demand more roles in maritime sector": "Women are often relegated to the back bench, especially in the maritime sector with the notion that they do not possess the physical and mental strength to wade through the rigours associated with the business. ANOZIE EGOLE writes that the women folk are ready to compete with their male counterparts for leading roles in the industry\nOftentimes, women are considered as weaker vessels and as such, not fit enough to handle some jobs or contracts, especially in the maritime sector. This explains the fact that in the Nigerian maritime industry today, women actively involved in the clearing processes are less than 20 per cent of the total licensed agents in the sector. Most of them operating around the ports axis are the ones, involved in point-of-sales services, sales of recharge cards, food vendors, and phone calls among others.\nThis can be attributed to how society perceives women to be people who do not really have the physical strength or mental capabilities to carry out some tasks even though in the real sense of it, there is practically nothing a man can do that a woman cannot do.\nFindings have also shown that the recent development in the maritime sector shows that most ship-owners do not like having female seafarers on board their vessels, a development that has left many qualified female seafarers jobless while their male counterparts are allowed to work even when some of them may not be as qualified as some of the females. \nMeanwhile, findings have shown that most women have proven to be more diligent and committed to assigned duties and responsibilities than their male counterparts when given the opportunity.\nSome of the challenges the maritime sector is facing could be a result of women not being given the opportunity to contribute their quota in the industry.\nIn a recent chat with the PUNCH in Lagos, the Nigerian Chapter Chairperson of Women in Maritime Africa, Mrs. Rollen Macfoy, spoke on the need for women to also be given equal opportunity in the sector like their male counterparts.      \nShe appealed to the new Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola, to ensure capacity building for women and consider the women in his appointments, adding that by so doing, women will be more productive to drive the sector forward.\nMacfoy laments that African women in maritime are not being encouraged and so they are very few. \u2018\u2019We are women of substance, we are courageous and we are experienced in different areas or sectors in this industry. We want to tell our new minister that we are ready to cooperate with him and put our shoulders on the wheel with him to drive this new ministry. We also want to crave his indulgence to consider women in his appointments, being gender sensitive.\u201d  Related News   Trucker blames hoodlums for 65% drop in haulage  Nigeria, Korea collaborate on shipbuilding  70% global trade done through maritime \u2013 FG   \nFight with ship-owners\nAt the 2023 Lagos International Maritime Week, the Vice President of the Female Seafarers Association of Nigeria, Damilola Adebimpe, raised the alarm on the level of denials the women face in the sector.\nAdebimpe who was represented at the event by Louis Njoku, said the opportunities are not always there for women to function like their male counterparts in the sector.\nShe said, \u201cSome Nigerian ship-owners do not take female seafarers. That is what we are trying to do; we are trying so much to speak to ship-owners to let them know that a woman is the same thing as a woman. What men are doing these days can\u2019t be compared to what women can achieve. The ships themselves are not built in such a way to allow women. They will tell you they only have facilities for males; there are no facilities for women so we can\u2019t take women. So it is a great challenge and that is what we are facing but we keep advocating, we will keep talking until our voices are heard,\u201d She said.\nMacfoy, however, reiterated the need for women empowerment in the sector to be able to function optimally.        \n\u201cFor WIMA, we are a gender advocacy group and we engage in mainstream participation and we cannot do this without empowerment. Just a few days ago, one of us had issues about license renewal which will cost her N1m. We rallied round her and raised N2m for her to travel to the Philippines for that purpose. On her return back to Nigeria, we also facilitated how she got a job.\nMacfoy also disclosed that her association is offering scholarship to children in secondary schools that want to pursue a career in maritime. \u2018\u2019And we have been instrumental to many of them entering the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, and Oceanography. I personally visit Oceanography to sensitize them.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the Nigerian Chapter Chairperson of Women in Shipping and Transport Africa, Eunice Ezeoke, advocated for women to take the leading positions in different government agencies, especially in the maritime sector.\nShe said, \u201cOn the issue of women advocating for the clearing of the waterside, I have nothing against that however, there is a cost to that. At WISTA, one of the challenges we are having is that everything we do we sponsor it by ourselves. It is not easy for women to undertake such projects that would have been sponsored by the local, state, or federal government. And even some government agencies. The function of women especially in a professional association like this is not just to clean the waterways. We want to be policymakers, we want to be in boardrooms, and we want to head agencies and corporate organisations. We can also speak and would also want to be on the other side of the table. So we must take note of that. While we are cleaning the beaches and the environments, we would also want to be in the board room as well.\u201d Ezeoke concluded.",
    "Marketers urge FG to address rising gas prices": "The Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers has called on the Federal Government to find ways to ensure stability of gas prices and make it available to the common Nigerians.
